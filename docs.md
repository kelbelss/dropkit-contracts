# DropKit Documentation

## How it works

Anyone wanting to do an airdrop can create one using their own token or an ERC20 generated by DropKit.


## Future plans

`function withdrawUnclaimedTokens(uint256 _dropID) public {}` - allow drop creators to withdraw tokens that have not been activated after activation period has expired.
