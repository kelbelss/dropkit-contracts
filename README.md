# DropKit (coming soon)

**DropKit** is a token distribution protocol that realigns communities and projects by combining vesting with game-theoretic, financial incentives, and utility.

## Problem

Today, many token distributions suffer from a misalignment between recipients and the projects they receive tokens from.  
People farm airdrops, dump their allocations, and leave — weakening the community and the project's long-term future.

At the same time, traditional vesting locks tokens away without allowing them to contribute to the ecosystem (e.g. providing liquidity, participating in governance, etc.).

## DropKit's Solution

DropKit solves this by:

- **Penalising dumpers**: Selling early incurs penalties.
- **Rewarding committed participants**: Holding and engaging with the project unlocks better rewards.
- **Enabling utility for vested tokens**: Projects can allow vested tokens to be used for productive purposes — like providing liquidity, participating in governance, or lending — without full unlocks.

## How It Works

1. **Game-Theoretic Vesting**: 
   - Vesting schedules are combined with economic incentives to encourage aligned behavior and disincentivize premature exits.

2. **Utility Modules (coming soon)**:
   - Smart contract modules let projects enable specific uses for vested tokens:
     - Provide liquidity on DEXs
     - Participate in governance votes
     - Lend or stake in DeFi protocols
     - Other project-specific activities

3. **Customisable Configurations**:
   - Projects can define penalty curves, reward systems, and permitted token utilities based on their specific needs.

## Benefits

- **Stronger Communities**: Incentivises recipients to act in the best interests of the project.
- **Aligned Incentives**: Penalises misaligned behavior while rewarding participation and loyalty.
- **Productive Tokens**: Tokens are not idle — they can contribute to liquidity, governance, and protocol growth even while vesting.
- **Customisable**: Projects can tailor the mechanics to fit their unique tokenomics and goals.

## Get Involved

DropKit is designed for any project serious about building a sustainable, engaged community.
